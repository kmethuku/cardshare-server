## Cardshare

## Project Info

**Cardshare** is a flashcard hub for books outside of the formal education context, made for lifelong learners.

Cardshare was **written in 6 days**, and later converted to Typescript and tested (see **Contributors** for more information).

Users can: 
  * Create flashcard decks
  * Search for available decks by book
  * Save decks and study them using the flashcards interface
  * Export decks as a csv file to use with their favorite flashcard app
  * Vote on decks
